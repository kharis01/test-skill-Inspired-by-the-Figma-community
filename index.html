                    <div class="detail-one-text">
                        <p>
                            No. All tobacco products have risks but comparing hookah to cigarettes is erroneous and
                            misleading.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hookah is heated at a temperature that is four times cooler than a burning cigarette and
                            creates an aerosol that is 75% water (60%) and glycerol (15%). By contrast, cigarette smoke
                            is 75% tar, carbon monoxide, and nicotine .
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most people enjoy hookah in moderation, far less often than typical smokers light up a
                            cigarette. In the United States, for example, 90% of people who enjoy hookah do so no more
                            than once per month. In comparison, the average American cigarette smoker will smoke 14
                            cigarettes per day.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hookah takes time to prepare and cannot be transported easily or used “on the go.” Hookah is
                            a unique cultural and social experience, whose history, ingredients, and use make it
                            incomparable to other tobacco products characterized by high frequency use.
